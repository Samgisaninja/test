<p>Hi there, you've reached the address for my cydia repo, but it appears you decided to place it directly into a web browser. I'm guessing you're trying to install one of my pacakges, to do this you'll need to add my repo to Cydia or Sileo or whatever package manager is "hip" these days.&nbsp;<br /><br />If youre using ye olde Cydia, you can add my repo by clicking this link:&nbsp;<a href="https://cydia.saurik.com/api/share#?source=https://samgisaninja.github.io">https://cydia.saurik.com/api/share#?source=https://samgisaninja.github.io</a></p>
